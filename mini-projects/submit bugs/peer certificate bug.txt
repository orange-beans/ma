When you run the submit script, to fix the error "urlread: peer certificate..." issue, and also some other types of "urlread" errors, do the following:

This patch is for Octave only. No patches are required for MATLAB users.

Note 1: If after you apply the patch, you get an error message like "structure has no member: part feedbacks", then re-enter the patch by hand-typing it in - there is probably a problem with how your text editor (for example the TextEdit program in OS X) handled copy-and-paste of the single-quote characters.

Note 2: Do not use Wordpad as a script editor. It is a word processor and can cause all manner of problems in your script files. Use the GUI editor in Octave or MATLAB, or use a plain-text editor such as Notepad++.

Note 3: Be sure you use "sprintf(...)" in the modification, not "printf(...)"

For Windows users:

1) In the exercise /lib folder, edit and save the file submitWithConfiguration.m, changing line 66 from this:



1
responseBody = urlread(submissionUrl, 'post', params);
to this:



1
[code, responseBody] = system(sprintf('echo jsonBody=%s | curl -k -X POST 
    -d @- %s', body, submissionUrl));
2) Then restart Octave.
